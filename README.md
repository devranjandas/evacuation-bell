## Welcome to the Project Home Page
### Introduction
An "Alarm" device has to be created using Arduino Nano board. The device has 3 momentary push buttons with lamp on the Front face and one health LED. This device shall be used for sounding 3 different Alarm patterns when a particular push button is pressed. The device gives out a single relay contact output. This relay contact is used to sound the bell. The bell is not part of the device and the output relay contact is used to sound a remote bell. 

### Skills required
1. Arduino Programming
2. Bread boarding
3. Github & Git skills
4. Schematic drawing using Geppetto

### Requirement
1. The device shall be powered from AC mains.
2. There shall be 3 push buttons(PB) on the front panel. All push buttons shall be momentary pushbuttons with indicators. 
3. There is one health LED. Health LED is a diagnostic LED and shall indicate that the system is healthy.
4. When a particular PB is pressed, a particular pattern/sequence is generated by the relay contact. This sequence or pattern runs for 2 mins.
5. It shall be possible to abort the sequence in between by pressing the PB that started sequence.
6. When a pattern is going on,the PB LED shall be showing the pattern.
